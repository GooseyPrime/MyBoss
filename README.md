# üìã Operator's Manual

## üöÄ Initial Setup & Deployment

### Environment Variables
Configure these required environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/myboss` |
| `DASHBOARD_TOKEN` | Shared secret for API authentication | `your-secure-token-here` |
| `INGEST_URL` | API endpoint for CI integration | `https://myboss.up.railway.app/api/ingest` |

### Railway Deployment
1. Click the Railway deploy button above
2. Configure environment variables in Railway dashboard
3. Database will be automatically provisioned
4. Verify deployment at your Railway URL

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/GooseyPrime/MyBoss
cd MyBoss
pnpm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your values

# Database setup
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed

# Build and start
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## üîß Daily Operations

### Monitoring Dashboard
Access your dashboard at `https://your-domain.railway.app/dashboard` to:
- View latest audit results across all repositories
- Monitor security findings by severity level
- Track audit run success/failure rates
- Review patch plan recommendations
- **Set up new GitHub repository audits** - Use the interactive setup tool
- **Configure Make.com webhooks** - Integrate with automation workflows

### Health Checks
Monitor these key metrics:
- **Database Connectivity**: Check PostgreSQL connection status
- **API Endpoint**: Test `/api/ingest` responds to authenticated requests
- **Audit Frequency**: Ensure repositories are running scheduled audits
- **Finding Trends**: Watch for increases in high-severity findings

### Log Monitoring
Check application logs for:
```bash
# Successful audit ingestion
"Ingest response: 200"

# Authentication failures
"Unauthorized access attempt"

# Database connection issues
"Database connection failed"
```

## üîê Security Operations

### Token Management
The `DASHBOARD_TOKEN` secures the `/api/ingest` endpoint:

1. **Rotation Schedule**: Rotate tokens quarterly
2. **Update Process**:
   ```bash
   # Generate new token
   openssl rand -base64 32
   
   # Update in Railway dashboard
   # Update GitHub Secrets in all repositories
   ```
3. **Emergency Rotation**: If compromised, rotate immediately

### Access Control
- Dashboard access is not authenticated by default
- Consider adding authentication for production deployments
- Audit database access should be restricted to application only

### Secrets Management
Repository secrets required for each audited repo:
- `DASHBOARD_TOKEN`: For API authentication
- `INGEST_URL`: Your MyBoss API endpoint

## üîç Audit Management

### Understanding Findings
Findings are categorized by severity:
- **Critical**: Immediate action required (RCE, data exposure)
- **High**: Security vulnerabilities requiring prompt attention
- **Medium**: Security weaknesses to address in next cycle
- **Low**: Best practice improvements

### Responding to Findings
1. **Triage**: Review findings in dashboard by severity
2. **Investigate**: Examine file references and line numbers
3. **Apply Patches**: Use generated patch plans as guidance
4. **Verify**: Re-run audits to confirm fixes
5. **Document**: Track remediation in your security system

### Audit Frequency
- **Push Events**: Audits run on every push to main branch
- **Scheduled**: Daily audits at 3:00 AM UTC via cron
- **Manual**: Run `pnpm exec tsx scripts/run-audit.js` locally

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Management

### Adding New Repositories
You can now use the dashboard interface to add audit workflows to new repositories:

1. **Dashboard Method** (Recommended):
   - Go to `/dashboard` in your MyBoss application
   - Use the "GitHub Repository Audit Setup" section
   - Enter your GitHub Personal Access Token (requires `repo` and `workflow` scopes)
   - Select repositories from GooseyPrime and InTellMe organizations
   - Click "Setup Audits" to automatically configure workflows and secrets

2. **Script Method** (Legacy):
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-pat"
   export DASHBOARD_TOKEN="your-dashboard-token"
   
   # Run setup script (prompts if env vars not set)
   node scripts/setup-audit-workflows.js
   ```

The dashboard method provides a better user experience with:
- Token security (stored locally with expiration)
- Real-time repository selection
- Visual feedback and error handling
- Integration with Make.com webhooks

For detailed setup instructions, see [GITHUB_AUDIT_SETUP.md](./GITHUB_AUDIT_SETUP.md).

This script will:
1. Add `.github/workflows/audit.yml` to each repository
2. Configure required GitHub secrets
3. Enable automated auditing

### Repository Requirements
Each audited repository needs:
- Node.js 20+ environment
- `pnpm` package manager
- `scripts/run-audit.js` file
- GitHub Actions enabled

### Excluding Repositories
The setup script automatically skips repositories containing "dashboard" in the name. Modify the script to exclude additional repositories as needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Audit Failures
**Symptom**: Repositories showing failed audit status
**Solutions**:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs in the repository
2. Verify Node.js and pnpm versions match requirements
3. Ensure `scripts/run-audit.js` exists and is executable
4. Check network connectivity to dashboard API

#### API Ingestion Errors
**Symptom**: Audits run but data doesn't appear in dashboard
**Solutions**:
1. Verify `DASHBOARD_TOKEN` matches in both places
2. Check `INGEST_URL` points to correct endpoint
3. Review API logs for authentication errors
4. Validate audit.json format against schema

#### Database Connection Issues
**Symptom**: Dashboard shows connection errors
**Solutions**:
1. Verify `DATABASE_URL` format and credentials
2. Check PostgreSQL service status in Railway
3. Run database migrations: `pnpm db:migrate`
4. Test connection with: `pnpm exec prisma db pull`

#### Missing Dependencies
**Symptom**: Build or runtime errors
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Reset and reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install

# Regenerate Prisma client
pnpm exec prisma generate
```

### Performance Issues
- **Database Growth**: Monitor finding and audit_run table sizes
- **API Rate Limits**: GitHub API calls are limited by token
- **Memory Usage**: Watch Next.js application memory consumption

## üîÑ System Maintenance

### Database Maintenance
```bash
# View database statistics
pnpm exec prisma db pull

# Clean old audit runs (older than 90 days)
# Run this query in your database client:
DELETE FROM audit_runs WHERE started_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';

# Optimize database performance
VACUUM ANALYZE;
```

### Backup Procedures
1. **Database Backups**: Railway provides automatic backups
2. **Manual Backup**:
   ```bash
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
   ```
3. **Configuration Backup**: Export environment variables securely

### Updates & Upgrades
```bash
# Update dependencies
pnpm update

# Update database schema
pnpm db:migrate

# Update Railway deployment
git push origin main
```

### Monitoring & Alerts
Set up monitoring for:
- Audit run failures across repositories
- High/critical findings that require immediate attention
- Database performance and storage usage
- API response time and error rates

## üìä Scaling Operations

### Adding Team Members
1. Provide dashboard URL access
2. Share documentation and runbooks
3. Grant necessary GitHub repository permissions
4. Configure notification preferences

### Multi-Organization Support
- Deploy separate MyBoss instances per organization
- Or modify scripts to support multiple GitHub organizations
- Ensure proper token scoping for cross-org access

### Performance Optimization
- Consider database indexing for large datasets
- Implement audit result caching for frequently accessed data
- Set up CDN for dashboard static assets
